## My process

So the process was not difficult per se. I had just finished my first HTML+CSS+SASS course in Udemy and completed this first challenge with almost no issues. The thing is that there were a lot of bad practices in the code and better ways of implementing this challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS reset(https://github.com/mayank99/reset.css) - To baseline cross-browser styles

### What I learned

I thought that I was going to recap of what I have learned, which I actually did but most importantly, I acquired new knowledge and learned better coding practices.
